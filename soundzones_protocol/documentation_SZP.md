This file will document SZP.

As it is a 7th layer protocol, it is treated as a Point-Point communication

| Defines | Values |
|---|---|
| IPv | IPv4 |
| Transport protocol | UDP |
| Port | 1695 ( Seemingly not used ) |
| Transmission encoding | utf-8 |

## Main Structure

[CID, {payload} ]

* CID - Command Id
* payload - Data to send (Structure depends on the CID)

## Commands 

### Command groups

| Range | Name |

| 0x00 - 0x10 | Normal use |
| 0xA0 - 0xC0 | Configuration |
| 0xF0 - 0xFF | Debugging |

### Command list

|CID | Name | Description |

### 01 - send

To use this command, client has been preconfigured with a Id.
So the rigth filters is used for the right Id.

| Tag | Size [bytes] | Value | Description | 
|---|---|---|---|
| cid | 1 | 0x01 | Command Id |
| time | Depends on encoding | - | Time to play the block of sound |
| payload_len | Depends on encoding | - | Length of payload |
| payload | 1 | - | Payload |

<!--
```
@startuml 01_send
server -> client: [ cid, time, payload_len, payload ]
@enduml
```

### A1 - enroll_c - client assigned id's
To use this command, client has been preconfigured with a Id.
So the rigth filters is used for the right Id.

| Tag | Size [bytes] | Value | Description | 
|---|---|---|---|
| cid | 1 | 0xA1 | Command Id |
|  client_id | 1 | 0x01-0xFF | Assigned client id (0 is reserved for server) |
| res | 1 | 0 \| 1 | denie \| accept |

<!--
```
@startuml A1_enrole_c
server <- client: [ cid, client_id ]
server -> client: [ cid, res ]
@enduml
```
-->

### A2 - enroll_s - server assigned id's
To use this command, it has to be figured out afterwurds which client needs what filter.

| Tag | Size [bytes] | Value | Description | 
|---|---|---|---|
| cid | 1 | 0xA2 | Command Id |
| client_id | 1 | 0x01-0xFF | Assigned client id |
| ack | 1 | 0x01 | Accepted |

<!--
```
@startuml A2_enrole_s
server <- client: [ cid ]
server -> client: [ cid, client_id ]
group succesful
    server <- client: [ cid, ack]
end
@enduml
```
