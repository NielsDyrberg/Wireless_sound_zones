version = 0.0.2

This file will document SZP.

As it is a 7th layer protocol, it is treated as a Point-Point communication

| Defines | Values |
|---|---|
| IPv | IPv4 |
| Transport protocol | UDP |
| Port | 1695 ( Seemingly not used ) |
| Size of msg_len | 2 bytes |
| Endianess | Big-endian |

## Main Structure

[msg_len, CID, {payload} ]

* msg_len - Length of message
* CID - Command Id
* payload - Data to send (Structure depends on the CID)

## Commands 

### Command groups

| Range | Name |
|---| ---|
| 0x00 - 0x10 | Normal use |
| 0xA0 - 0xC0 | Configuration |
| 0xF0 - 0xFF | Debugging |

### Command list

|CID | Name | Description |
|---|---|---|
| 0x01 | [send](#01---send) | Send a payload to a client |
|||
| 0xA1 | [enroll](#a1---enroll) | Used by client to enroll |
| 0xB3 | [set_sound_format](#b3---setsoundformat) | Sets the format of the music |
|||
| 0xF1 | [checkCon](#f1---checkcon) | Used to check connection, used for debug |

## 01 - send
This command is used to send sound data to the client.

| Tag | Size [bytes] | Value | Description | 
|---|---|---|---|
| msg_len | 2 | - | Length of message |
| cid | 1 | 0x01 | Command Id |
| time | 8 | - | Time to play the block of sound |
| payload | - | - | Payload |

<!--
```
@startuml 01_send
server -> client: [ msg_len, cid, time, payload ]
@enduml
```

### Time Encoding
[ mm, ss, ms, µs, ns ]
| Byte| Range | Description | Symbol |
|---|---|---|---|
| 1 | [ 0-60 ] | Minute | mm |
| 2 | [ 0-60 ] | Second | ss |
| 3-4 | [ 0-1000 ] | Mili second | ms |
| 5-6 | [ 0-1000 ] | Micro second | µs |
| 7-8 | [ 0-1000 ] | Nano second | ns |

## A1 - enroll
To use this command, client has been preconfigured with an Id.
So the rigth filter is used for the right Id.

In order for the client to be configured with an Id, it has to be planned where each client is located in the room, the master should then have the plan so it knows where wich id is located.
A client is then configured according to where it is located. And then uses this Id to enroll.


| Tag | Size [bytes] | Value | Description | 
|---|---|---|---|
| msg_len | 2 | - | Length of message |
| cid | 1 | 0xA1 | Command Id |
|  client_id | 1 | 0x01-0xFF | Assigned client id (0 is reserved for server) |
| res | 1 | 0 \| 1 | denie \| accept |

<!--
```
@startuml A1_enrole_c
server <- client: [ msg_len, cid, client_id ]
server -> client: [ msg_len, cid, res ]
@enduml
```
-->

## B3 - set_sound_format
Sets sound format.

| Tag | Size [bytes] | Value | Description | 
|---|---|---|---|
| msg_len | 2 | - | Length of message |
| cid | 1 | 0xB3 | Command Id |
| format_id | 1 | 0x01-0x04 | Payload format type. Supported types can be found under [supported formats](#supported-formats) |
| raw_setup | 3 | - | (Only used if format_id == 0x01) Bytes describing how to handle the Raw file. Described in [raw_setup](#rawsetup) |

<!--
```
@startuml B3_set_sound_format
server -> client: [ msg_len, cid, format_id, (raw_setup) ]
@enduml
```
-->

### Supported formats
| Id | Name | Notes |
|--- |--- |---|
| 0x01 | Raw | Raw only supports Mono |
| 0x02 | WAV ||
| 0x03 | FLAC||

### raw_setup 

[ sample_rate, sample_resolution ]

| Name | Size [Bytees] | Value | Description | Notes |
| ---|---|--- |---|---|
