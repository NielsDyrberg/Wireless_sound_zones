# Wireless Sound Zones

Wireless sound zone is a multispeaker client-server audio player, where all clients are time synchronized with the server to play audio synced down to xx ms.
Its build for the purpose of making it possible to wirelessly stream the audio required for a sound zone setup, as each speaker needs to play with as little
jitter as possible, and play a different audio track dependent on the filter.


## How does it work

Small little harry potters are inside each raspberry pi, and they swish their wands to make the music go **BOOM!**


## Installation

To install either the server or client, simply clone the repository to the raspberry pi, and run either server_setup.sh or client_setup.sh
ItÂ´s important to run the setup files login as root, or else you need to manually unblock the wifi

To install as client run:

    sudo su
    git clone https://github.com/NielsDyrberg/Wireless_sound_zones.git
	./Wireless_sound_zones/Client/client_setup.sh
	
To install as server run:

    sudo su
    git clone https://github.com/NielsDyrberg/Wireless_sound_zones.git
	./Wireless_sound_zones/Server/server_setup.sh
	
If you do not wish to run the install as root, simply run `sudo rfkill unblock 0` after install. For some reason it cannot run this inside a shell script
